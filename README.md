# VoyagerNavigation

This is a sample app that utilizes voyager navigation library, which is a great library for Kotlin multiplatform 
apps
Testing has also been done using reflection to test private methods.
The tests mostly follow the TDD, and thus scenarios are thought of before the code actually breaks on the client side, thus some methods are 
intentionally made to fail, thus testing passes(which means the app will not break while the user is using the app because the scenario was predicted and 
handled appropriately)
